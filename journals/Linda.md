Today I worked on:
Working with Clarissa to set up our database in Mongo Atlas
Testing the use of MongoDB and motor in our sharents_blogpost app

    Defining all our sharents microservices
    Worked with Clarissa to create ONE microservice (user_management) and determining what the files should be in the folder, including having the pyproject.toml and poetry.lock file inside of EACH microservice
    Creating labels for issues
    Researching how the concept of foreign keys will work in mongoDB
